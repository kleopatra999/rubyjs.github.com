title: RubyJS now free and MIT licensed
---

RubyJS is a port of the Ruby corelib to JavaScript. It's similar to underscore/lodash/sugarjs in that it adds many  methods that are missing in JS. It's not about the Ruby syntax or a coffeescript alternative, just about the standard library.

### Initial plan

The initial plan was to go with a MIT license. However at one point I was obsessed with RubyJS and wanted to work full time on it. Charging for commercial use would allow me to do that, I thought. But there's only a few libraries that could make this system work. I hoped RubyJS could become one of these exceptions, but the conclusions of numerous discussions is that it most probably won't.

### Don't swim against the current

It doesn't make sense to swim against the current. So after a week full of discussions with rubyists and JS developers, I decided to switch back to an MIT open source license. Accept reality, fail fast, fail early.

### No hard feelings

No hard feelings, I knew charging for a JS library was controversial and a ballsy move. I learned a lot, debated a lot and increased my comfort zone quite a bit. And so I'm back into consulting mode. Available for hire.

### Go get it

Go get it: [github.com/rubyjs/core-lib](http://github.com/rubyjs/core-lib).

Check the [getting started guide](/gettings-started.html), or the [api docs](/doc/index.html). Try it in your Firebug/webdev console.
